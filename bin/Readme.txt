DbgVision

Description:
Is an application that lets you monitor debug output on your local system. It is capable of displaying Win32 debug output, so you don't need a debugger to catch the debug output of your applications.

The lightweight application is less than a megabyte, and it is compatible with Windows 7 and higher operating systems. You can download either the installer or portable version.

To activate portable mode, create "dbgvision.ini" in application folder, or move it from "%APPDATA%\Henry++\DbgVision".
